### OOP Concepts
> Go is not object-oriented. So there is no inheritence and the only form of polymorphism in Go is interfaces.
Go only support run time polymorphism through interfaces. Compile time polymorphism is not possible in Golang.

Go doesnâ€™t directly support method/function/operator overloading but variadic function provides a way of achieving the same with increased code complexity.
